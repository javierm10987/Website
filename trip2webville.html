<h2>A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register their own domain name. See if you can find these classmates and ask them how they did it. What is the process involved? Where can you go to register a domain name?</h2>
<p>
<li>I couldn't find anyone</li>
<li>but somewhere you can go to register is this link http://www.internic.net/regist which is provided in the book</li></p>
<h2>Compare the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this point) with the one we use. How are they different? How are they similar?</h2>
<p>
<li>The workflow of the book and our workflow is that the book does almost everything for you and our workflow is do it on your own and explore they are similar in information</li></p>
