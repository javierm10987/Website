<h1>Special Characters</h1>
<p>Since &lt;,&gt;, and & have special meaning in <code>HTML</code>, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called <q>special charcters</q> to represent them. For example, to have  a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use &amp;lt to represent it.</p>
