    <h1>Kindness</h1>
    <p>Before you know what kindness really is
    <br>
    you must lose things,
    <br>
    feel the future dissolve in a moment
    <br>
    like salt in a weakened broth.
    <br>
    What you held in your hand,
    <br>
    what you counted and carefully saved,
    <br>
    all this must go so you know
    <br>
    how desolate the landscape can be
    <br>
    between the regions of kindness.
    <br>
    How you ride and ride
    <br>
    thinking the bus will never stop,
    <br> 
    the passengers eating maize and chicken
    <br>
    will stare out the window forever.
